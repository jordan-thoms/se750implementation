These are notes that may help with issues in building or running BuGLe, reflecting me experience in using the lib:


*Changes, fixes, notes

Made changes in gldb-gui-buffer.c:472 - change to g_free to fix crash on MSVC
Noticed filters.c:342 will get an incorrect default address on windows for filters and will cause a silent crash out, fix by setting the BUGLE_FILTER_DIR environment variable

linux needs CFLAGS as -DDEBUG_CONSTRUCTOR at build time to prevent some runtime errors

scons config=debug CFLAGS=-DDEBUG_CONSTRUCTOR
soncs config=debug CFLAGS=-DDEBUG_CONSTRUCTOR install

---

to build on windows with msvc pass host-compiler=msvc

---

follow the instructions in the docs carefully! for install

---

HAving an already installed gtk+ set if binaries can clash with the sources

---

to link to the shared lib on linux use "LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libbugle.so <executable>" when running the program from the command line

---

to get state you need to use the globjects filter set

---

lines 2563 glstate.c:         return strdup("<GL error>"); /* altered from "return "<GL error>";" - Bryce */

---

Have to add:
#ifdef __cplusplus

extern "C" {

#endif

to fix linker errors when using C++

_Later note - but where?

---

budgie_type comes from budgie/types.h

---

include headers but link against bugle.so

---

hashtable.h at the end needs:

#ifdef __cplusplus

}

#endif

---

bugle calls can mess up if there's no gl Context (e.g. CALL(<some function>) seems to fail (but only sometimes?))

---
execv-ing:
args[2] = bugle_asprintf("BUGLE_CHAIN=%s LD_PRELOAD=libbugle.so BUGLE_DEBUGGER=fd BUGLE_DEBUGGER_FD_IN=%d BUGLE_DEBUGGER_FD_OUT=%d %s", chain ? chain : "", out_pipe[0], in_pipe[1], command);

causes a stall for some reason?

_Later note - think this is needing to send a run signal to the prog

---

The hashtable uses set to insert elements

The begin and next functions are used as part of walking the hashtable (getting each 'value' in turn from what I can tell)

---

need to run as super user to get certain features of the debug filter set to work (?)
